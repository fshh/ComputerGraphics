# OpenGL/Qt Graphics Renderer

This repository contains several graphics demos created as part of Northeastern University's Computer Graphics
class in Spring 2020.

The demos are written in C++14 using [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and [Qt](https://www.qt.io/).

# Summary of Demos

-   Draw triangles using a vertex buffer and an index buffer
-   Process vertex, color, texture, and normal data from .obj files
-   Render full 3D models with texture and normal maps
-   View a scene with a perspective camera
-   Dynamically light models with multiple point lights
-   Apply post-processing effects using a framebuffer
-   Implement solar system model using a scene graph system for applying transforms to parent and children objects
-   Generate a terrain mesh from a heightmap image
-   Create a 4D vector and matrix math library
-   Manipulate an image file to darken it
